The "In-Semester Assessment System" is a platform designed to efficiently show semester-wise and division-wise teacher allocations and monitor question paper submissions. This system allows faculties to efficiently allocate question papers to specific courses, divisions, and semesters. It keeps track of the submission counts for question papers across different courses and divisions, ensuring that no details are missed. With a user-friendly interface and secure access controls, it ensures smooth operations and a seamless experience to faculty members.
